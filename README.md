We’d like to take a moment and thank you for your involvement with the Columbia Organization and Rising Entrepreneurs. CORE has grown exponentially this past year, and we’ve reached 2000 subscribers to our newsletter, 2000+ Facebook likes, and almost 700 Twitter followers. Whether you have subscribed to our newsletter, attended our events, partnered with us for our programs, spoken at our events, gotten involved with our competitions, or supported us in any other way, we could not have come this far without you. We launched over 87 new programs and event series this year, and we’d like to look back at what we have accomplished together
